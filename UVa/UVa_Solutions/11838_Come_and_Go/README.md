### General Comments

This is a Strongly Connected Components (SCC) finding problem. I used Tarjan's algorithm because I still haven't read about Kosaraju's algorithm. Tarjan's algorithm isn't easy to grasp to be honest and thus all what I can do is to refer you to the page number in which it is explained thoroughly in CP3.

You can find the explanation of the algorithm in pages *133* and *134* in the book CP3.
