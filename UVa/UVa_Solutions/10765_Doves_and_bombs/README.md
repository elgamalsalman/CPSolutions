### General Comments

This is an articulation points finding problem. The dfs based algorithm it uses isn't easy to grasp to be honest and thus all what I can do is to refer you to the page number in which it is explained thoroughly in CP3.

You can find the explanation of the algorithm in pages *130* to *133* in the book CP3.
