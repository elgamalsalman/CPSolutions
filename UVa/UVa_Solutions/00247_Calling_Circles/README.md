**Code:** [00247.cpp](./00247.cpp)

# Explanation

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup> + m) though O(nlogn + m) could have been possible with the addition of one simple array, but it isn't necessary.

**Memory Complexity:** O(n + m)

### General Comments

This is a Strongly Connected Components (SCC) finding problem. I used Tarjan's algorithm because I still haven't read about Kosaraju's algorithm. Tarjan's algorithm isn't easy to grasp to be honest and thus all what I can do is to refer you to the page number in which it is explained thoroughly in CP3.

You can find the explanation of the algorithm in pages *133* and *134* in the book CP3.
