**Code:** [00907.cpp](./00907.cpp)

# Explanation

> This problem is very easily solvable with binary search in O(nlogs) where s is the sum of all distances given. However, I intentionally used dp solely for practice, as this was one of the problems in DP on implicit DAGs in the book CP3

**Time Complexity:** O(N<sup>2</sup>K)

**Memory Complexity:** O(NK)

**Category:** Dynamic Programming (DP) / Graph Theory
