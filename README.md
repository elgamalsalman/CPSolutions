# CPSolutions

## Solutions for problems in the following websites:
* [UVa Online Judge Solutions](./UVa)
* [Codeforces Solutions](./CF)

## Motivation
I have started preparing for the IOI a few months ago so I have decided to share my journey with others in order to encourage more people to learn about programming and CS in general. At first I will be reading the book "Competitive Programming 3" (which I call "CP3" for short) by Steven and Felix Halim and solving problems on the website which occompanies it ([UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/)). Hopefully, the list of problems and websites from which these problems are taken will grow over time.

## General Description
I will publish here some of my solutions to algorithmic coding problems from different websites. I will do my best to write explanations for as much solutions I publish here as possible. My solutions are not necessarily the fastest out there as overkilling it may just be a waste of time in a competition environment, though I occasionally do so to challenge myself; however, I have submitted all solutions shared here and they were all accepted by the judge. 

## Explanations
Explanations generally will accompany most problems, but I don't guarantee writing an explanation to every problem due to time constraints.

## Programming Language
I will be using C++14 if available in all online judges as at the date of writing this, the IOI doesn't support C++17. However, if C++14 isn't available in a website then I will use C++11.

#### I hope you find this helpful and I wish you all the best of luck, happy coding :)
