### General Comments

This was one of my first problems to try rated at 1700 and I found it pretty hard to solve, although I found the connection between the answer and the fibonacci numbers, I couldn't solve it.

The editorial wasn't very clear, but it mentioned that solving the problem involves reducing it to a simpler famous problem called the strip problem which you'll find the explanation for in the comments, read it and then read the editorial again and with some thinking you'll hopefully see the connection between the two problems.
